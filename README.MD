# Hotspring Iceland App

* Its an app for tourists where you can find all the hotsprings in Iceland

## React Native with expo

* Just something for fun imported react-native-maps in it on the Homescreen , made a bottom-tab-bar with reac bottom-tabs dependency, where you can switch between pages but I need more time to work on those components. I will for sure because I like this keep on working on this  project.

* Run - expo start - in the termial to start the project scan the code and run it on your "Expo Go" app in your phone to try it out.
